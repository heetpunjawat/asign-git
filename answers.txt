What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
What does fast-forward in git mean?
Why should you have different branches?
In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

Ans1. 
gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files to ignore when committing the project to the GitHub repository. 
It will ignore directories with the specified names
For a java file, gitignore should ignore: 
*.class  *.log  *.ctxt  .mtj.tmp/  *.jar  *.war  *.nar  *.ear  *.zip  *.tar.gz  *.rar  hs_err_pid*

Ans2. 
Fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch. In fast-
forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.

Ans3.
Branching created another line of development in the code. Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code 
base and isolate their work from others. This keeps the main code unaffected and free from any errors. Later on ,this branch can 
be merged with the main code using merge command. Also, Branches in Git help the team, which are in different parts of the world 
work independently on independent features that would ultimately combine to produce a great project.

Ans4.
A remote Git repository is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. Usually, every project 
should have only one remote repository, because it is the default remote created by Git when you clone an existing repository, 
which is called the origin. But is is possible to have multiple remote git repositories, by keeping a different name for the 
remote repository.
